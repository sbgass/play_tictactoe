How to Run the Program: 

This program was written in python 3 and takes two input arguments to run. The game board prints to the terminal in each turn. 

The inputs are the player types and can be any of the following: human, random, alphabeta. 

For example, running the following command from the program's directory will start a new game between a human player as player one and a alphabeta player as player two: 

"python3 tictactoe.py human alphabeta"

Player Options: 
"Human" players require user input to play moves. 
"Random" computer players will play random moves in each turn. 
"Alphabeta" computer players use a the alphbeta pruning extension to the MiniMax algorithm to search to the end states of the game and choose the optimal move in each turn. 

All computer players are stochastic, so each game will be unique.
